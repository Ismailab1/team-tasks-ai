Hello frends

the following files are in need of improvements, 
and will be part of our production backend

    1. apiv1.js [version to be updated]
        This file needs to be brought up to standards outlined in
        GitHub issue 31 https://github.com/Ismailab1/team-tasks-ai/issues/31
    2. cosmos0-1.js [version to be updated]
        This file needs:
            a. better error handling
            b. data cleaning/validation (i.e., if user enters incorrect
            data we should tell them to fix it before we waste CosmosDB
            queries)
            c. The "Unique" IDs are not truly unique currently, we will
            need to check which IDs exist already to ensure we do not create 
            duplicates

The following scripts are for "testing" (im bad at devops)
    1. apiTest.js: script to test apiv1, run with the command
        npx mocha apiTest.js
    We're using the mocha testing framework
    https://mochajs.org/

    2. cosmosDriver.js: script to execute commands from the cosmos0-1 file
    This was used by myself to populate our existing DB with users & tasks
    running it now won't update our DB (the data is already there
    and the primary key will prevent duplicates) but might count towards
    our RCUs (money money money $$$)

Our data is in the file dummyData.json
I've been using ChatGPT to add to this collection, I would just add the file
to the chat and see what it comes up with
